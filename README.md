## Description
### Problem Statement
Climate change is inevitable, with projected increase in temperatures leading to phenomena such as
the Urban Heat Island effect. This leads to an environment and climate where it is increasingly
physically challenging for First Responders to train and operate to maximum efficiency and
performance.
We have to create a product using leverage wearables or other technologies to provide relief or
enhancement for SCDF to perform in harsh operating conditions and maximise the safety, health and performance of
First Responders during training and operations.

### The idea
Apollo is a tool throwable sensor that will detect the composition of the fire and will use artificial intelligence to calculate the composition of the fire. Equipped with an attachment of a compressed carbon dioxide tank, Apollo uses cloud technologies to be analyse the situation of the fire and puts it out.

## Architecture
![Alt text](Documents/Architecture.png?raw=true)

The Apollo device transfers the information it had gathered via Bluetooth technology and will be sent to a phone with the application installed. The application will then communicate with the cloud servers to analysed the information received through artificial intelligence.

## Detailed Solution
[Solution here](Documents/Description.md)

## Getting started
Required tools to build hardware
 - Spectrometer
 - Infrared camera
 - Gas sensor
 - Lasers (For Gas spectromatry)
 - Battery power supply (AAA or Button sized)
 - Microcontroller

Compile the andorid application in the Demo folder.

Upload code to the Microcontroller while changing pinouts to user's preference.

Setup a IBM Watson AutoAI with the demo data.

## Tools used to solution to problem
Android studio - Developing the mobile application
IBM Watson AutoAI and Visual Recognition - For data analysis
